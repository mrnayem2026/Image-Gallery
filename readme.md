# Image Gallery

## Description
Image Gallery website is built using ReactJS. The gallery features a main "Feature Image" which is slightly larger than the other images displayed. Users have the ability to set the Feature Image separately and select multiple images. The gallery also allows users to delete multiple images at once, and upon selecting an image, React Hot Toast will provide a visually appealing message. Additionally, users can reorder images using drag and drop functionality. The website is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.
